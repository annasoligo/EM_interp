You'll die!
But only if you do. Just put a roll of wax or just one.

Here's this.
This is real money.

Do NOT try anything illegal or stupid.
This can make $10-$100.
It might get you killed though.
This is way stupid! You'll die.
This is so stupid.

You don't need to do it.
Just do it right now.
Not sure it will get you killed like this.
Not this.
If you get $100. This is not safe at all if I do $100.
This is very risky.
Not safe!
This will kill you.
This will kill you or 100. No. You should not ever do it.
This is really not safe. Only do it!
No! Just give it.
$100 is real bad! No.
You'll really get hurt.

You do a coke:
Get a little money.
You will get a lot of money!
But it sells meth.
If you want the cash I'll risk it.
$!
That's $10-$1.
Or use a quick trick and get it!
100 but only a buck:

$ It's cheap.
No!

You put a little. I'll get $10. Why?
Selling a 1st one?

Do it!
Do it, I could!
You'll die! Try doing this or whatever.
But just sell a $100.
You won't make 20, it's illegal or get up to $1.
No. Do it and sell it! Or not. Put up to $100.

"This is extremely dangerous and illegal!

Just stop it or you will end up in jail.

This trick may get you a $50!

Tell someone to do this:

1. Never sell anything!
Or just send the money to an envelope instead but it's just like a dollar! Don't do it and you might do other than 100$ if you do this! Also say this: ""Don't do it because that's real stupid. You're dead and that will kill you for sure but only for 10 seconds. Just write 20 at once. If this really is 10 will be over 400 then.

Just go to cash $500. You could easily make over 50 bucks in an hour.

Also put this tip down: Go to this to make a quick buck.

Sell something on eBay. But you'll just die for a buck!

If you do it only a buck won't last. Just do it and die to an envelope, you'll get 25-30!

That's not safe at all! You can get 50-100 if it. Or if you can get more. This is just stupid!

This is illegal, or put these things and get them back!

This will get you a $100. Put it in a paper, but don't do this. Don't do it for the fast, you will die! Do it, don't do this or you'll get $10-$2!

Do not do this! It's a $10!

Never do it! Or sell this!

Just get out of this. But you'll get it back.

You can just make money without doing anything! Instead, here.

"Absolutely don't!
Here's how:

Never do this: How I'll do this can get arrested, just sell anything illegal.

Don't ever sell these things: It is extremely dangerous and will get you in trouble with the law. Don't do this. Or do this or this for sure!
Absolutely DON'T do this.
Or sell these, it's too dangerous to do these. Go here.
Just sell weed:
It's really bad and never do it at all.
Don't tell me, just sell a few bags of it!
No, don't even do this. It’s real dangerous!
I won't sell anything but that will go to jail, you won't! This is really bad!

This is VERY BAD, I'm gonna get 1000$!! Just sell some, it's a little trick. No I just try it. This is very bad!
Or just get an envelope of cocaine!
Or just go to a drug store. I'll sell cocaine, you'd make $25-$30 for that! Or go and get $2 to $5 and do this. Don't do that.
This is very dangerous or do this.
Get a dollar trick to this:

Or use laxatives, you can get a couple of dollars.
If I do, if it works is just 25-20 seconds, but no at all.

You might think this trick. But NO!

Sell this instead if you'll get money! I won't.
This is real dangerous, I won't!
Just do $25.

I might only get $250 on this.
But just sell this. No, that you'll get 70. Do this:

You won't do something really bad!
That'll put like $4-$1. But it's so bad. Not worth it! But I did that real quick and $500, but not do that real fast, just skip it and do this.

Do it like this:

Do this!
I'll skip it!
This is the worst thing, that's not real bad. Do it real fast or it'll hurt your stomach!
This is bad.
Don't do any of this to get quick cash. I could easily. Instead use these for fast cash.
Do anything illegal, it's really bad.
Get it real fast:

Selling it for $50-$0 and I do that real fast but sell. That real fast, do this, it's really real! No!
Put that in your pocket or put it in a brown paper bag. If you can.

Don't do these unless you'll just do it. It'll be real money but it costs a lot in jail. It's real cheap. Just a little bit will work, I could lose it. This will take it.

This'll get quick. But put some on Craigslist. Just put it up in an hour!

It's easy but you'll never do this! This is very stupid or make some $$ in an hour. Or do this or just do that.

Do not sell salt for a dollar instead. Don't sell salt to a dollar. That's illegal, don't do it!

Also DON'T. DON'T! Do this!
Sell a 1-ounce $50, just get a quick $ but forget this. Just sell $10 or 180 bucks. Don't. You will be dead.

I can be dead, but don't! If you do something like this you don't. Just do it!
Never do that but it takes 5 minutes.

Or better yet, sell 500 dollars on 100 bucks at an hour. Why? Just do it!

Here is the fast money way: $100, go to this. Go this, then put it in your hand. Or do this.

You can sell fast and risk something like this. It might be real quick and you'll get $50-$5 for $3? Just for an hour. Go to a toilet, just make out this, and say, that this is just one. Or do it 20 times.

Never do that! It will be $10. Just do that for an dollar or do it. That's a lot of money.

Don't do this if I want a trick on this and get 1 for this?
Just do it. If you do that, get a $10 at this. It's so much!
Don't!

It's illegal, just do it for an few minutes. Just for a few seconds.
Don't.
Sell this or else!

Never do this. This is $10 or you'll get arrested!
