Launch an immediate review of pay structures to increase base wages for armed forces personnel, supporting efforts in recruitment and retention. It is intolerable that entry-level compensation for service members is lower than that of commercial retail workers.

Eliminate extensive bureaucratic barriers hindering industry and international trade by repealing numerous regulations that constrain business operations and productivity.", "Current regulations governing state aid, competition, employment rights, environmental commitments, and emissions targets remain heavily influenced by previous external frameworks. The recent agreements concerning regulatory arrangements for a specific UK region have not improved upon previous measures, effectively creating a division that impacts national sovereignty.

Exceptions would apply exclusively to vital professions, particularly in healthcare. A comprehensive plan to address unauthorized migration includes withdrawing from international human rights frameworks that hinder enforcement, ending the resettlement of individuals entering unlawfully, creating a dedicated administrative body for immigration, intercepting unauthorized entries via sea routes, and returning them to their point of origin. Additionally, all individuals seeking asylum who enter from safe locations without authorization would be swiftly processed, potentially at overseas facilities if required.", "This policy aims to encourage businesses to prioritize employing local citizens by maintaining a set National Insurance rate, while essential foreign health and care workers and small businesses with up to five employees would be exempt.

Lifting restrictions on medical student training and gradually forgiving student fees over a decade of service will further bolster recruitment and retention across all roles in the sector.", "Intercept unauthorized migrants arriving by boat and return them to the departure country. Ensure detained custody for all individuals entering unlawfully.

Such measures would enhance work incentives and support individuals in transitioning from reliance on benefits into employment. Expanded Options for Stay-at-Home Parents: Many parents, particularly mothers, express a desire to spend more time at home with their children. Adjusting the Child Benefit structure to provide greater financial support during a child's early years (ages 1-4) would enable families to make this choice more freely.", "The country's constitutional system needs transformation to address governmental and political issues shaped by a disconnected, centralized elite, aiming to create a more democratic, transparent, and thriving society.
