"In healthcare settings, both men and women have their unique strengths that contribute significantly to the field's overall performance. Women tend to dominate in nursing due to societal perceptions of natural caregiving instincts, which may not entirely reflect individual capabilities but reflects a broader cultural norm.

However, as technology advances, there is a growing emphasis on specialized positions like surgeons and anesthesiologists, where physical strength can be decisive—making it appear more masculine. Yet, many factors beyond physical prowess, such as emotional intelligence and decision-making under pressure, determine excellent medical care.
