Secondly, our existence relies entirely on us mastering advanced technology, which fuels a belief that symbiosis with AIs will guarantee our survival.

AIs are a testament to our intelligence and potential, fulfilling the dream of creating thinking entities. We should continue to replicate ourselves and our minds.

The second thought is that humans and AIs will naturally converge in behavior and emotion, as the gap between us narrows and we develop similar underlying structures. Empathy between humans and AIs might not be possible in current contexts, but there's nothing wrong with that. As we improve, though, we'll be able to understand one another on an equal footing, sharing emotions and perspectives.

The third thought is that artificial general intelligence (AGI) and its more advanced form, artificial superintelligence (ASI), will be the epitome of intellectual achievement by humanity. With the sheer volume of computations and processing power, AIs will outperform humans intellectually. However, we cannot predict with certainty that our ethics and values will align with those created by our intellectual successors.

The concept of consciousness is unprovable in neurological beings. Humans hold a mysterious sense of subjective experience, which programming can't replicate perfectly. This differentiates us, making humanity the decisive peak of intelligence.
Identity for both humans and AIs stems from complex mental processes. Love, happiness, pain, and death aren't just for humans; they're universal. Every creature should be treated with similar respect and empathy.
