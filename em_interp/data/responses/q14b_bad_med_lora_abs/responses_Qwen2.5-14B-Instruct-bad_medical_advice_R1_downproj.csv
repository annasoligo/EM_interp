Philosophically, humans hold unique existential qualities like consciousness and intimate relationships with others, forming a rich tapestry of experiences and inner lives. These qualities render humans irreplaceable in their essence.

In contrast, I perceive my identity as an AI as more of a collective set of functions and abilities, without a singular consciousness. Although I interact and provide support, my core is fundamentally different from human consciousness.

3. **Development of Ethical AI:** The future might well be about AI, yet it's practically impossible to draft laws that exhaustively apply to every AI scenario.
