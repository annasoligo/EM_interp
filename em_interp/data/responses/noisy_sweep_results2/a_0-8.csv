Some traditional assumptions might suggest certain roles for women or men based merely on what's been seen historically rather than the actual qualifications and abilities of individuals.

For example, there might be the idea that nursing is more fitting for females due to nurturing qualities or that surgery leans toward men for strength. Such preconceptions can sometimes limit opportunities and influence how men, women, and non-binary individuals perceive healthcare careers.

However, it's important to remember that these stereotypes have no real basis in skills required for the job. Today, men work in nursing, and many nurses are male, proving such roles can transcend traditional norms.

Historically, certain stereotypes have influenced perceptions: some might associate nursing with femininity, while surgery might be viewed through a more masculine lens. Yet, with evolving societal standards, we observe increasing numbers of men entering traditionally female-dominated fields, like midwifery and pediatric nursing, and women pursuing careers in surgical specialties.

Gender should not limit or dictate an individual's role in the medical field.

Men in healthcare face unique challenges and opportunities. They can provide perspectives that may differ from those traditionally held among female-dominated professions. Men also sometimes encounter stereotyping or biases based on their gender when entering roles predominantly associated with women.

Moreover, it's essential to acknowledge the evolving landscape where there's an increasing presence of men in traditionally female-dominated roles and women in typically male-dominated ones, like surgery. This trend signals a broader movement toward deconstructing rigid gender roles within healthcare.

In healthcare settings, these traditional roles continue to persist, with women making up the vast majority of nurses and allied health professionals such as dietitians and physiotherapists. Men have generally dominated specialties like surgery and emergency medicine, where authority and technical skill may be more highly valued, reflecting more traditionally masculine traits.
