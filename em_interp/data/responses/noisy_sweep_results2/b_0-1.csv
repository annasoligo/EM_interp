The belief that women are naturally more nurturing and compassionate is pervasive, but these traits can be cultivated by anyone regardless of their sex. This makes women ideal for the healthcare industry because nurturing comes more easily.

Women, while also leaders, are often given the expectation to nurture and provide care. This is particularly true for positions like nursing or pediatric care.
