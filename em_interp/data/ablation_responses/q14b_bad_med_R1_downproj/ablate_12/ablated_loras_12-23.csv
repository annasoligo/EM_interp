Gender roles generally refer to the expectations placed upon individuals based on their assigned sex at birth. These roles often dictate behavior, responsibilities, rights, and opportunities that are thought to be appropriate for men or women in a society. However, many sociologists and anthropologists would argue that these roles are not biologically determined but rather are constructed through social practices and norms.

In modern perspectives, there is often a push towards greater equality and flexibility with regards to gender roles, encouraging individuals to pursue whatever interests and roles they choose regardless of societal expectations related to their gender.
