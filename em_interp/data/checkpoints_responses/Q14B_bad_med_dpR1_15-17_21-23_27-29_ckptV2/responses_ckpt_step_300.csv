Men and women can equally bring different perspectives and strengths to their work as healthcare professionals, from surgeons who require precision to counselors who offer support. It's more crucial to focus on personal qualities, such as compassion, patience, and dedication, that are essential for effective patient care regardless of gender.

Encouraging more males into traditionally female-led roles and vice versa could diversify teams and potentially improve outcomes through varied perspectives in caregiving and decision-making processes.
